# Reflections Lesson 2: Creating and modifying a repository

## What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

By initializing a repository via `git init`, a version history is added to the
working directory, and all files that are included in the repository can be
tracked for changes. For this, they need to be added to the repository using the command `git add`. This can be further configured by defining files to be ignored.

## How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


## How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

## What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

## How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

## What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

## What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
